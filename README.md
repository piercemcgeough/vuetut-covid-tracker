# VueTut - Covid-19 Tracker

## Overview

I followed Traversy Media's tutorial [Build a Covid Tracker App With Vue.js & Tailwind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-MAIpnH9ag).

In this tutorial Brad takes us through building a vue app using the vue-cli. The app will show summary data from the latest Covid-19 stats. We make api calls to an external source and display them in our app.

I altered my code to extract a few more components and make more resuable parts of the application. This is a great tutorial especially for beginners but it's always a good reference point for those more advanced developers.
